# Welcome

Hi! I am Chris Desjardins. 

I am a statistician at the FDA working on applications of AI/ML. I have been working on implementing a Claude 3.5 Sonnet model to generate reports to support FDA investigators inspections of firms, developing a model to optimize firm assignments for consumer safety officers, and developing several different Shiny/Python applications to explore imported goods that are regulated by the FDA. 

Prior to joining the FDA, I was an assistant professor of mathematics and statistics at [St. Michael's College](https://www.smcvt.edu/) and an associate research scientist and data analyst at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) and [Oregon Research Institute](https://www.ori.org/). I am interested in data visualization, data science, applied statistics, and AI/ML. 

## Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Educational-Measurement-and-Psychometrics-Using-R/Desjardins-Bulut/p/book/9780367734671"><img align = "left" width="100" height="150" src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978036773/9780367734671.jpg"></a>


[Okan Bulut](https://github.com/okanbulut) and I wrote a book (and an [R package](https://github.com/cddesja/hemp)) on using R for educational measurement. Topics include: classical test theory; generalizability theory; the factor analytic approach in measurement; unidimensional, multidimensional, and explanatory item response modeling; test equating; visualizing measurement models; measurement invariance; and differential item functioning.
