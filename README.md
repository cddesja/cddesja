## Selected Data Visualizations
### Shiny
- #### [Minnesota Study Survey](https://cddesja.shinyapps.io/Minnesota-Student-Survey-2013-to-2019/)
  This dashboard shows student performance at the school-level on various domains measured on the Minnesota Study Survey. This was created while I was at the [Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement](https://carei.umn.edu/) and the target audience was school administrators. 

- #### [Visualizing Atlantis Diagnostic Tool](https://cddesja.shinyapps.io/Visualizing-Atlantis-Diagnostic-Tool/)
  This Shiny app (and associated [R](https://github.com/cddesja/vat) package) were created to help [Atlantis](https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/) modelers better understand and tune their models. 
 
### Tableau
- #### [Change in Abortions from 2020 to 2023](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.desjardins/viz/NYTimesAbortionStory/Dashboard1)
  The purpose of this dashboard was to recreate the visualization shown on the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/07/us/abortion-data-bans-laws.html) and show to my Data Visualizations students how quickly visualizations can be created in Tableau.

- #### [Tracking COVID-19 in Vermont](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.desjardins/viz/COVID-19inVermont/VTDashboard)
  This COVID-19 dashboard was created for prospective public health students at [St. Michael's College](https://www.smcvt.edu/).
